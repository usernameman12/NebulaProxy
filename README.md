# NebulaProxy

NebulaProxy is a multi-purpose web proxy portal that lets you browse websites securely and enjoy integrated games and appsâ€”all in one place. No terminal commands needed; just deploy on Vercel!

## Features
- **Home:** Welcome page with easy navigation.
- **Games:** Access web-based games via our proxy (e.g. Snake and Tetris).
- **Apps:** Launch popular sites like Google and YouTube through the proxy.
- **Settings:** Customize your experience (e.g. dark mode).
- **Proxy:** Enter any URL to browse via our proxy server.

## Deployment
Push the project to your Vercel account. The `api` folder contains the serverless proxy functions, and static files are served from the `public` folder.

Enjoy NebulaProxy!
